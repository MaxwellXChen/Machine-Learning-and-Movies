## Introduction/Background:

The movie industry is an essential part of recreation and entertainment for billions of people. Over the past couple of decades, however, the industry has completely changed. Streaming giants such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and Disney have changed the way consumers view both newly released and older films. Different streaming platforms house different types of movies- while some are more specific to genre, others are more specific to age range. An article in Finder showed that Netflix had an average IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes score of 83% for its movies and shows. Meanwhile, Disney had an average rating of 81% and Amazon Prime had 78%. Hulu was not included in this study. (Ojogbede, 2021)

## Problem Definition:

Given various parameters of a movie or TV show, such as genre, target age, runtime, and production country, our project aims to predict the Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb ratings, as well as which streaming services will carry the program. This serves to  provide movie producers with the information that will be useful in predicting the critical and commercial success of projects that are in development, allowing them to target the service most likely to pick up their movie or TV show while optimizing movie parameters to maximize ratings. 

## Methods:

We are planning on creating a multilayer neural network using Python's Tensorflow library that would take in multidimensional inputs and output a 3 dimensional vector corresponding to Rotten Tomatoes rating, IMDb rating, and a list of streaming services that would provide this movie. In addition to the neural network model, we also plan to apply linear combination and multiple linear regression to develop a secondary model.

## Potential Results and Discussion:
We are hoping to accurately predict the performance of up-and-coming movies as well as verify the accuracy of our model using past movies as data. We also hope to predict which popular streaming services would pick a movie up for streaming based on our input parameters. This model could be useful for the media entertainment industry as it can be applied in predicting the critical success of various projects as well as identity trends that lead to success.

## Potential Timeline:

We should have all data preprocessed and cleaned as well as a functioning model (>30% accuracy) at least by 11/6. By the Project midpoint deadline (11/16) we should have a model that is tuned and more accurate. We will also have more detailed information on our problem definition, data collection, and methods we will be using.
